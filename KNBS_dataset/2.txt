In the realm of economic indicators, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) stands out as a vital measure of a nation’s economic health and stability. This indicator, like a compass, helps guide decision-making for policymakers, businesses, and the public. We’ll explore how the CPI is calculated and what it tells us about Kenya’s economic well-being.
Definitions 
Core inflation derived statistics from  the  national CPI which is intended to show underlying inflation by excluding price movements arising from transient or volatile product groups. Items in categories of food and energy are excluded.
 Non- core inflation is derived statistics from national CPI which show price movements of volatile products group ( items with very volatile price changes)
The Consumer Price Index describes the price changes of goods and services purchased by households in Kenya and it is used as a general measure of inflation. Price data are collected for the statistics and the data is published monthly.
Measuring Price Changes: The CPI tracks changes in the cost of a basket of goods and services commonly purchased by households. It’s a key indicator of inflation’s impact on everyday expenses.
Overall Inflation Trend: The headline inflation rate reflects the broad inflation trend in Kenya, providing an overview of the general price increases affecting consumers.
Stripping Out Volatility: Core inflation excludes volatile food and energy prices, offering a more stable view of underlying inflationary pressures.
Essential Goods and Prices: Monitor food inflation to assess changes in the cost of basic food items, which directly impact household budgets.
CPI is published monthly.
